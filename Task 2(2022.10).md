# Task 2(2022.10)
## Should one get fined for using phones when crossing the road?
### [example]

- ***Due to the legal requirement that aligned with the one regulating drivers' conducts, pedestrians should get fined for using cell phones when crossing the road.***
**<表明观点，扣题>**

- ***Using phones when driving can easily distract drivers' attention from the road condition to the appealing content being displayed on the screen. Subsequently, the lack of concentration in this case may finally lead to the unpredictable tragedies, which merely originates from the ignorance and arrogance of safety risks. Hence, the implementation of traffic laws can optimally confine the driver's improper usage of cellular phones. Nevertheless, such restriction of the phone usage shoould invariably be applied to every participant of traffics that also include pedestrians. If most pedestrians were fully absorbed in phone texting or watching videos while crossing the road, the traffic situation would be nothing but chaotic scenes flooded with the impatient drivers and pedestrians waiting at the crossroads totally at a loss.***<br>
